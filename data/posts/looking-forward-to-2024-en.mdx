The year of 2023 has finally passed. Due to the harshness of the year, I decided
not to write a year-end summary after several attempts but instead write an
article looking forward to the year of 2024. I just saw a tweet that suggested
imagining what kind of person you want to be in five years and then working
towards that goal every day this year. What do I want to do in five years?

## Becoming "Indie"

I haven't decided whether or not I'll still be "working" in five years. While I
don't dislike my current job, there are times when I wish for more freedom over
how my time is spent. On Twitter, many independent developers (like
[@waylybaye](https://twitter.com/waylybaye)) have caught my attention with their
unique and user-friendly apps on mobile devices. Although finding original ideas
can be challenging as it often feels like everything has already been done
before, perhaps some "micro-innovations" based on existing applications could
work.

Aside from iOS development, independent game development is also something that
interests me greatly. After playing [Hollow
Knight](https://www.hollowknight.com/), creating a similar Metroidvania-style
game became one of my aspirations; however, getting started with Unity always
seems daunting due to its complexity. Of course, besides hard skills such as
programming and design abilities required for these "independent" jobs, soft
skills like self-marketing social interaction and time management are equally
important.

## On Track Towards FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early)

While working isnâ€™t something that bothers me much, nor am I worried about
having a job at the age of 40 or 50, I do hope to work purely out of interest
and not worry about layoffs. Becoming an independent developer is one aspect of
achieving this goal, while another is investing. I've been working for about two
years now and regretfully haven't saved much money. My income isn't "low" but
most of it goes towards mortgage payments, food, and travel expenses. Recently I
started using [Copilot](https://copilot.money/), a budgeting app that uses AI to
categorize my spending which has made managing finances easier than before.

## Health and Appearance

Since high school, "keeping fit" has always been something I struggled with due
to lack of exercise, poor eating habits, and insufficient sleep leading to
weight gain. Especially during the pandemic when staying at home became the
norm.

In addition to physical health issues there are other areas where improvements
can be made such as posture clothing style hair etc. On top of these things, I
also wish for a more confident smile, brighter voice. I'm hoping professional
coaching could help in this regard along with regular practice on my own part.

## Setting Goals

To strive towards these objectives, I would like to set some specific goals for
2024:

- Skills for Indie App Development
  - Learn product design brainstorm ideas document thoughts.
  - Learn iOS development (mainly Swift UI).
- Skills for Independent Game Development
  - Art: learn Blender Photoshop master AI generation tools practice drawing
    create artworks.
  - Design: study think about game design.
  - Programming: replicate classic games get familiar with Unity-like
    development tools.
- Financial Management
  - Control spending review bills budgets daily.
  - At least 30% monthly income should go into investments.
  - Actively seek investment opportunities.
- Health and Fitness
  - Exercise at least 30 minutes every morning evening. Continue swimming and
    tennis twice weekly.
  - Ensure minimum seven hours sleep daily.
  - Say no to takeouts snacks sugary drinks.
- Appearance
  - Seek professional coaching for posture correction facial expression
    management voice training.
  - Reflect on my clothing style monthly, and buy new clothes.

Here's to hoping 2024 will be a good start.
