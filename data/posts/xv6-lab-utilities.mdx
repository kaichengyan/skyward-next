I have been recently watching lecture videos from MIT's Operating Systems class,
and doing the xv6 labs. I took Operating Systems in college, but my professor
was not very good at explaining things. He does not use slides, but simply draws
some very abstract diagram on the blackboard, without much annotation. I thought
taking the class again following the MIT lecture videos would help me understand
Operating Systems better, and maybe someday allow me to write my own.

I finished the first lab
“[Utilities](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2023/labs/util.html)” in a bit
over 2 hours. The lab mainly consists of writing 5 short user-space programs for
xv6. These are “utility” programs that can be found in UNIX, and are implemented
using existing system calls in xv6. Most tasks aren’t challenging and should be
very easy for someone with some C experience, but the `primes` task took me over
1.5 hours.

## The Sieve of Eratosthenes

The `primes` program implements the **[Sieve of
Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)** algorithm
using `fork` and `pipe`. The main idea is described in [this
article](https://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/).

Briefly, the `primes` program has a root process that sends numbers 2 through 35
to a sieve process. The sieve process can spawn more sieve processes, and all
sieve processes do the same thing:

1. Receive a number $p$ from its parent.
1. Print $p$ as a prime.
1. Continue receiving numbers from the parent. Spawn a child, and pass any
   number that is **not a multiple of $p$** to the child.
1. Exit when the parent is no longer sending numbers (closes the pipe).

In the end, each sieving process will print out exactly one prime, and rule out
all multiples of that prime for future processes.

## The root process

Things seem straightforward so far. Since the root process is different from the
sieve processes, we would need to handle it separately. We can write the
following skeleton pretty quickly:

```c
#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "kernel/stat.h"
#include "user/user.h"

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int pp[2];
  pipe(pp);

  if (fork() == 0) {
    // sieveing processes
  } else {
    // root process simply sends 2-35 to the first sieving process
    close(pp[0]);
    for (int i = 2; i <= 35; i++) {
      write(pp[1], &i, sizeof(i));
    }
    close(pp[1]);
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

## The first sieve process

The [article](https://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/) describes what each sieve process
should do in pseudocode. We can translate it to C code and try to plug it into
our skeleton:

```c
int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int p, n;
  int pp[2];
  pipe(pp);

  if (fork() == 0) {
    // sieving processes
    if (read(pp[0], &p, sizeof(p)) <= 0) {
      close(pp[0]);
      exit(0);
    }
    printf("prime %d\n", p);

    int newpipe[2];
    pipe(newpipe);
    // spawn a child so it can read from newpipe[0]
    while (read(pp[0], &n, sizeof(n)) > 0) {
      if (n % p != 0) {
        write(newpipe[1], &n, sizeof(n));
      }
    }
  } else {
    // root process
    // omitted
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

At this point, we realize that the first sieving process is working with 2
pipes: a pipe created by its parent (`pp`) and a pipe created by itself
(`newpipe`). The parent process writes to `pp[1]`. The sieving process itself
reads from `pp[0]` and writes to `newpipe[1]`. The sieving process will spawn
another child, which will read from `newpipe[0]`.

Let's try to add the `fork()` call to the above code:

```c
int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int p, n;
  int pp[2];
  pipe(pp);

  if (fork() == 0) {
    // sieving processes
    if (read(pp[0], &p, sizeof(p)) <= 0) {
      close(pp[0]);
      exit(0);
    }
    printf("prime %d\n", p);

    int newpipe[2];
    pipe(newpipe);
    if (fork() == 0) {
      // next sieving process
      // ???
    } else {
      // current sieving process
      while (read(pp[0], &n, sizeof(n)) > 0) {
        if (n % p != 0) {
          write(newpipe[1], &n, sizeof(n));
        }
      }
    }
  } else {
    // root process
    // omitted
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

After `forking()`, our current sieving process will start forwarding `n` to the
next sieving process. But what does the next sieving process do (the `???`)?

## The next sieving process

Recall that `fork()` starts a child process in the exact same state as the
parent process. Therefore, the next sieving process starts right at the `???`
comment in the above code. The newly spawned process wants to read `p` from
`newpipe` which was created in the parent process. We have already implemented
this logic (although we were reading from `pp`), but we have already gone past
it! How do we go back up to reading `p` again?

The `goto` statement comes to mind, but we can also use a `while` loop and the
`continue` statement as a replacement.

```c
int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int p, n;
  int pp[2];
  pipe(pp);

  if (fork() == 0) {
    // sieving processes
    while (1) {
      if (read(pp[0], &p, sizeof(p)) <= 0) {
        close(pp[0]);
        exit(0);
      }
      printf("prime %d\n", p);

      int newpipe[2];
      pipe(newpipe);
      if (fork() == 0) {
        // next sieving process
        continue;
      } else {
        // current sieving process
        while (read(pp[0], &n, sizeof(n)) > 0) {
          if (n % p != 0) {
            write(newpipe[1], &n, sizeof(n));
          }
        }
        exit(0);
      }
    }
  } else {
    // root process
    // omitted
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

In the above code, we wrapped the entire logic for sieving processes in a
permanent loop. When the second sieving process spawns, it will go back to the
beginning of the loop and start anew, just like our first sieving process did.
Now, we just need to make it read from the pipe that our first sieving process
created. This can be done by simply renaming `newpipe` to `pp`!

To make things easier to understand, let's do some renaming. In a process's
context, let's call the pipe that it reads from (created by its parent)
`leftpipe`, and the pipe that it writes to (created by itself) `rightpipe`. We
end up with the following code:

```c
int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  // See https://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/
  int p, n;

  int leftpipe[2];
  int rightpipe[2];
  pipe(rightpipe);

  if (fork() == 0) {
    // first sieving process
    while (1) {
      // move rightpipe to leftpipe for reading
      leftpipe[0] = rightpipe[0];
      leftpipe[1] = rightpipe[1];
      rightpipe[0] = 0;
      rightpipe[1] = 0;

      if (read(leftpipe[0], &p, sizeof(p)) <= 0) {
        exit(0);
      }
      printf("prime %d\n", p);

      pipe(rightpipe);
      if (fork() == 0) {
        // child is created as a new sieving process
        continue;
      } else {
        // parent sends sieved numbers to next sieving process
        while (read(leftpipe[0], &n, sizeof(n)) > 0) {
          if (n % p != 0) {
            write(rightpipe[1], &n, sizeof(n));
          }
        }
        exit(0);
      }
    }
  } else {
    // root process omitted
  }

  exit(0);
}
```

Phew! Everything is looking good now. The root process sends numbers to the
first sieving process through its `rightpipe`.

For the first sieving process, the root process's `rightpipe` is its `leftpipe`.
Here, we are "moving" the fd from rightpipe to leftpipe, so the two fd slots in
`rightpipe` can be reused! The first sieving process reads `p = 2` from
`leftpipe`, prints it, and creates a new `rightpipe` for its child. Then it
passes sieved numbers `3, 5, 7, ...` to its child before exiting.

The second process does the exact same thing. Its `leftpipe` is the first
sieving process's `rightpipe`. It reads `p = 3` from `leftpipe`, prints it,
passes `5, 7, 11, 13, ...` to its child, and exits.

Looks like things are all working! The last thing we need to do is to make sure
that everything is cleaned up properly.

## Final code

```c
#include "kernel/types.h"
#include "kernel/stat.h"
#include "user/user.h"

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  // See https://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/
  int p, n;

  int leftpipe[2];
  int rightpipe[2];
  pipe(rightpipe);

  if (fork() == 0) {
    // first sieving process
    while (1) {
      // move rightpipe to leftpipe for reading
      leftpipe[0] = rightpipe[0];
      leftpipe[1] = rightpipe[1];
      rightpipe[0] = 0;
      rightpipe[1] = 0;

      // we are not going to write to leftpipe again
      close(leftpipe[1]);

      if (read(leftpipe[0], &p, sizeof(p)) <= 0) {
        close(leftpipe[0]);
        exit(0);
      }
      printf("prime %d\n", p);

      pipe(rightpipe);
      if (fork() == 0) {
        // child is created as a new sieving process
        continue;
      } else {
        // parent sends sieve numbers to next sieving process
        // we can close now since the parent won't need to read from rightpipe
        close(rightpipe[0]);
        while (read(leftpipe[0], &n, sizeof(n)) > 0) {
          if (n % p != 0) {
            write(rightpipe[1], &n, sizeof(n));
          }
        }
        close(leftpipe[0]);
        close(rightpipe[1]);
        wait(0);
        exit(0);
      }
    }
  } else {
    // root process simply sends 2-35 to the first sieving process
    close(rightpipe[0]);
    for (int i = 2; i <= 35; i++) {
      write(rightpipe[1], &i, sizeof(i));
    }
    close(rightpipe[1]);
    wait(0);
  }

  exit(0);
}

```

The final code looks a bit messy, but it works! We can run `make qemu` and run
`primes` in the shell to make sure it works.

```shell
$ make qemu

```

## What I Learned

I learned a lot about pipes file descriptors from this lab. There were a few
things that I didn't know before doing this lab.

For example,

- After a process with an open fd is forked, does the fd in the parent and child
  point to the same file?
- If the parent closes the fd, can the child still use its own fd?
- What's the difference between `dup(fd)` and simply assigning `fd` to another
  variable?
- When exactly do we want to close the read/write fds for a pipe?

If you are still a bit unsure about the questions above (like I am), I would
encourage you to try this lab yourself!
